# HRM
Heart Rate Monitor BLE Reader

This library reads Heart Rate from a chest worn heart rate monitor (HRM) using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This has only been tested on the [XOSS X2](https://xoss.co/products/xoss-chest-strap-heart-rate-monitor-bluetooth-ant), but should work with all standard BLE Heart Rate Monitors using the industry standard serviceUUID for Heart Rate: ```0000180d-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb```
